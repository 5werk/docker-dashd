# Dash masternode install tutorial
![We love Dash!](img/DASH.jpg)

This tutorial uses the [5werk/dashd](https://github.com/5werk/docker-dashd/) docker container to setup a [dash](http://dashpay.io/) masternode. If you don't know docker, check out their [website](http://docker.io/).

Follows this 6 steps to host your own masternode:

## 0. Prerequisites
You need to have root access to a **64bit linux server with Kernel 3.8+** (requirement to run docker) which ideally has a static public ip address in order to be a reliable dash masternode.

Additionally you need to own at least **1000 DASH** coins for operating a masternode. Since dash masternodes allow a hot/cold wallet setup, you don't need to put a wallet with coins on the server.

For this tutorial you should install **curl**, if its not installed already (like on ubuntu). On debian for example use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
```

## 1. Client: Prepare a wallet
Please install the latest version of dash-qt on your local computer. Download the executable file from the [dash](http://dashpay.io/) website.

### Always encrypt and backup your wallet
Make sure your wallet is encrypted with `Settings > Encrypt Wallet`.
Save the password. Now export your wallet with `File > Backup Wallet` to
a safe location.

### Generate a masterprivkey and transfer 1000 DASH
When your block-chain is synchronised you can create a masternode private key. Open the debug console at `Help > Debug Window > Console` and type following command:

```bash
masternode genkey
```

Save the output (long string of numbers and letters) in a textfile. You will need the key during **step 3**.

Now create a new account address with the following command:
```bash
getaccountaddress "My Masternode"
```

Now transfer exact 1000 DASH to this newly generated address using the `Send > Pay To:` Field. Make sure the field below reads `Label: My Masternode`.

## 2. Server: Install docker
Check out the [docker website](http://docker.io) in order to understand how to install docker on the specific linux distribution you are running.

The install command for ubuntu is as follows:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ubuntu/ | sudo sh
```

For debian, see [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/debian/).

## 3. Server: Create the dash.conf
Choose a folder where you want to house the dash blockchain and the server config file. In this setup we use `/var/dash`.

*Careful: this command overwrites the file /var/dash/dash.conf*

```bash
sudo sh -c 'mkdir -p /var/dash && curl -sSL https://raw.github.com/5werk/docker-dashd/master/dash.conf > /var/dash/dash.conf && chmod 0400 /var/dash/dash.conf'
```

You can now edit the `dash.conf` file (still with root permissions) using your favourite editor vim:
```bash
sudo vim /var/dash/dash.conf
```

Make sure the `dash.conf` is filled out with the masternodeprivkey you obtained during the first step of this tutorial. Change at least the following 3 entries of the template config file:

```config
masternode=1
masternodeprivkey=[FILL IN FROM ABOVE]
rpcpassword=[super secure random password with 30 or more characters. You probably never need to use it]
```

Since we set the permissions of the config file to owner read-only you have to save with
`<ESC>:wq!` in vim (the root user always has write permissions).

You can easily generate a random password using the following
command or a multitude of [other methods](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/30184/10-ways-to-generate-a-random-password-from-the-command-line/):
```bash
date |Â md5sum
```

## 4. Server: Install and run 5werk/dashd
You can use the provided `dash-server.sh` to download and run the **5werk/dashd** docker image. We recommend you install the script in `/usr/local/bin/` as follows:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'curl -sSL https://raw.github.com/5werk/docker-dashd/master/dash-server.sh > /usr/local/bin/dash-server.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dash-server.sh'
```

Change the default paths in the script, if you don't use `/var/dash`. If the script is configured to your likings install and run the **5werk/dashd** docker image like this:
```bash
sudo dash-server.sh install
```
This command creates a running docker instance named **dash-server**. Check out the status of the service with:

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

When the dash service started properly it begins to download the blockchain. You can check the current status with this command:

```bash
sudo docker exec dash-server dash-cli getinfo
```

Later you can use all the docker standard commands like `sudo docker restart dash-server` to restart the service. If the service isn't running use this command to investigate: `sudo docker logs dash-server`.

## 5. Client: Unlock the wallet

For the next step the server needs to complete to download the blockchain first. When the download finished you can go on your local pc and stop your **local** client. Open your **local** `dash.conf` file. Typical paths where you can find it are the following:

Operating System  |Path                                          |
------------------|----------------------------------------------|
Windows 7/8       |C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Dash    |
Mac OSX           |~/Library/Application Support/Dash/           |
Linux             |~/.dash/                                      |

Add the following config options:
```config
server=1
addnode=23.23.186.131
masternode=1
masternodeprivkey=[FILL IN FROM ABOVE]
masternodeaddr=[ip address of your server]:9999
```

Now start the client and open the console at `Help > Debug Window > Console`. To authentificate your remote server type the following into the console:
```bash
masternode start [your wallet password]
```
If successful, you will see a message like *"successfully started masternode"*.

***Congratulations! You successfully setup your dash masternode!***

## 6. Server: Upgrade the dash server periodically
Check periodically if the dash developers upgraded the dash runtime. We will try to keep the `5werk/dashd` docker image up-to-date. The upgrade process for you is relatively simple. Just run:

```bash
sudo dash-server.sh upgrade
```

If you have problems with the latest image you can always downgrade to a prior dash version (if it is still supported) using the following command:
```bash
sudo dash-server.sh install-version 0.10.16.15
```
